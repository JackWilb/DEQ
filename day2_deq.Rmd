# Day two

## Importing and writing data

## Importing data

``` {r}
# csv
read.csv()
read.csv2() # deals with semicolon delimiters

librar(readr) # The preferred package for importing common datatypes
read_csv()

# netCDF



# xlsx
library(readxl)

df <- read_excel()
df <- readxl_example("datasets.xls")
excel_sheets(df)
df <- read_excel(df, sheet = "chickwts")
# Can't re-run just the sheet command, has to be the whole thing again 


# txt files
# There are ways, we can discuss next time if people need it

# DATABASES (SQL over to the right) (do they have drivers?)
library(odbc)
con <- odbc::dbConnect(drv = odbc::odbc(), driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server", 
    server = "x.x.x.x", uid = "me", pwd = "123", 
    database = "R4W_003")

# Exporting data
write_csv()
write_ # explore options
# Each package to handle data comes with imports and exports (so depends on file type, etc)

# write xlsx as csv unless it's not possible, then use the package xlsx
```
